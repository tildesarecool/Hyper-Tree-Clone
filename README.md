# Hyper Tree Clone

### Extremely fast directory tree duplicator for Windows.

12 July 2024

This is something of a utility spin off from another script I am developing called [tiny11 python edition](https://github.com/tildesarecool/Tiny11PyEd). Which in turn is heavily inspired by a PowerShell script called Tiny11.

I wanted to see how fast of a file copy utility I could make after watching and reading several things about the [1 billion row challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) and associated Python version of the solution (all of which is entirely over my head).

I'm hoping to have some (very unscientific) time comparisons between reguarly drag/drop file copy, robocopy and this script. As well as comparisons on different sets of hardware. The benchmark against which all will be tested will be a Windows 11 install ISO.

Actual code coming soon.
